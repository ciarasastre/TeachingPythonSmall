We are going to do 3 types of variables
Integers (int) = Natural numbers 1, 2, 3,
Strings (str) = "This is a string" "Hello",
Float(float) = Unnatural number 2.4, 58888.00,

'''
#Here are my variables
greetingOne = "Hello my name is " # You can put a space in here
myName = str("Ms Sastre")
myMoney = float(50000.34)
myPin = int(1234)

#We can add some money first
myMoney = myMoney + 100

#Make sure we turn our numbers into strings first!
#print(greetingOne +" "+ myName) Or add a space like this
print(greetingOne + myName)
print("Thank you for entering pin number " + str(myPin))
print("You have \n" + str(myMoney) + " in the bank!")
