A Repo that holds what I taught First and Fourth year Secondary Schools.

### Lessons Folder
This contains all the python code that I would write up on the white board
for the girls to code into replit.

**Lesson1** 
> is the basics of Python. it is also paired with Python Basics Presentation.

**Lesson2**

strings as the girls would later be creating their own visual novels and story adventures.
This is also paired with the second Python presentation If Elif and Else.

**Lesson3** 
> is the code for using lists as well as introducing the use of functions and how variables work while created inside and outside a function.
